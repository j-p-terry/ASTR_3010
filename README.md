This is the repository for the ASTR 3010 course for UGA@Oxford during the Fall (Michaelmas) 2024 term. It will provide the basic code and information used for the course.

The class format will be 8 one-hour lectures. There will be a total of 5 assignments, the average of which will be the final grade. All assignments will be returned with feedback before the next assignment is released. The grading scale is as follows:

- 92-100%: A
- 87-91%: A-
- 85-87%: B+
- 80-84%: B
- 74-79%: B-
- 71-74%: C+
- 67-70%: C
- 65-66%: C-
- 60-64%: D
- 0-59%: F
